ABSAnalysis is an AI-powered web application for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis on mobile phone reviews. It automatically extracts key aspects (like battery, camera, display), classifies them into categories, and determines the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed toward each aspect. Users can upload CSV files and visualize the results through an interactive dashboard.
